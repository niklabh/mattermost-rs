# Migration Ledger

Go source pinned at: mattermost@9dfbaeca99f4096388fd1c048a9e6d1d0a86743e (2026-08-13)
Current phase: 1 — Core Types
Next file: server/public/model/user.go

Re-clone the reference source with:
`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost.git reference/mattermost`
then `git -C reference/mattermost checkout 9dfbaeca99f4096388fd1c048a9e6d1d0a86743e`

## Verified line ranges (valid at the pinned SHA)

`server/channels/store/store.go` is 1,472 lines — never read it whole. Use `sed -n 'A,Bp'`.

| Interface | Range |
|---|---|
| TeamStore | 135,199 |
| ChannelStore | 200,386 |
| PostStore | 387,447 |
| UserStore | 448,550 |
| SessionStore | 551,600 |

## Out of scope (do not migrate)

| Path | Reason |
|---|---|
| model/client4.go (8,526 ln) | Go REST client, not server code |
| model/permission.go (2,789 ln) | Generate from Go, do not hand-translate |
| model/config.go (5,795 ln) | Translate lazily, section by section |
| enterprise/ | Separate license; proxy to Go permanently |
| plugin host (hashicorp/go-plugin) | Keep Go process alive indefinitely |
| search (Bleve / Elasticsearch) | Deferred past Phase 5 |

## Progress

| Go source | Rust target | Status | Tests | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| model/utils.go | `mm-model/src/utils.rs` | PARTIAL | 54 pass | See notes below. Deferred: `IsValidEmail`, `IsValidHTTPURL` (need RFC 5322 / 3986 parsers), `ParseHashtags` (goes with post.go), `Scan`/`Value` (go to mm-store), the io.Reader JSON helpers (serde replaces them), `Etag`/`NewRandomTeamName` (need consts from other files). |
| — (tooling) | `reference/dump/behaviour.go` → `fixtures/behaviour_utils.json` | DONE | 12 diff tests | Behavioural oracle: runs a corpus through the real Go funcs and records the answers. Caught two bugs a reading of the source did not. Extend the corpus when translating anything with branching logic. |
| — (tooling) | `reference/dump/` → `fixtures/` | DONE | 10 fixtures | Parity oracle. Reflection-populated from zero values, so adding a type is one registry line; deterministic output (FNV of field path — no rand/time.Now, keeps diffs clean). Fails the run if a declared top-level key is missing from the JSON. Re-run and commit after adding a type. |

## Notes — model/utils.go

Non-obvious semantics found while translating. Each cost real time to discover; none is
recoverable by re-reading the Go source casually.

1. **`NewId()`'s doc comment is wrong.** It claims `[A-Z0-9]`. The alphabet is z-base-32
   `ybndrfg8ejkmcpqxot1uwisza345h769` — lowercase, and missing `l`, `v`, `0`, `2`. Do not
   "correct" a validator to match the comment.

2. **`IsValidId` does not check the alphabet.** It accepts any 26-**byte** string whose runes
   are all Unicode letters or numbers, so 13 two-byte letters pass. Length is bytes, not runes.

3. **`unicode.IsLetter` != `char::is_alphabetic()`.** Go tests general category `L`; Rust's
   method tests the Alphabetic *property*, which also covers `Other_Alphabetic` — so it
   accepts U+0345 and similar combining marks that Go rejects. `mm-model` depends on
   `unicode-general-category` solely to close this gap. The same trap applies anywhere Go
   uses `unicode.IsLetter`/`IsNumber`.

4. **`GetTimeForMillis` returns LOCAL time, not UTC** (`time.UnixMilli` attaches
   `time.Local`). `GetStartOfDayMillis`/`GetEndOfDayMillis` then read the calendar date off
   that local zone, so **their results depend on the server's timezone**. For
   `1700000000000` a UTC+05:30 host reports the start of Nov 15; a UTC host reports Nov 14.
   Any Rust caller doing date arithmetic inherits this. Treat as a Go bug we must reproduce.

5. **`AppError.Error()` emits a trailing `"W: "`** when `Message == NoTranslation` and the
   detail is empty — the separator is written before the message is skipped.

6. **`LimitBytes` can return invalid UTF-8** (it slices at an exact byte offset). A Rust
   `String` cannot represent that, so `limit_bytes` truncates at the nearest char boundary
   below the limit. This is the one deliberate behavioural divergence in the file.

7. **Go nil map marshals to `null`, not `{}`.** Struct fields that Go can leave nil must be
   `Option<StringMap>`, or `user.go` and friends will drift on the wire.
